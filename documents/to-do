To do:

the creation of new users should add them to the database in the first place instead of this non-sense:
	the notification server API should be able to initialise users, too
	the JSON RPC API should be able to initialise users, too

add proper handling of torrents which consist of single files instead of folders (this breaks the cleaner and the categoriser I think)
possible future issue: store NFOs with newlines instead of raping them (solved in the case of TL)
move the type specifications from configuration/ to site/
add a seed check for TV downloads?
add more customisation features to the search results in the shell
solve the on-download notification problem

Problematic:

symlinks should get updated when you add/remove a filter? - frequently you do not actually want this because you're just removing an old series or whatever

Done:

The JSON RPC server is one central process, unlike the shell, so the files it creates will have the wrong user (this will result in missing 'own' symlinks when using the download API)
need status stuff, XMLRPC data from rtorrent
add genre filters for TorrentVault
fix the dates in the TV database
add tcng/tcc QoS stuff - requires a proper kernel
the cleaner should remove symlinks, too
integrate further sites (TorrentVault, oh well)
add NFO filtering
add symlinks for NFO hits in the categoriser
the categoriser should check what user issued a download, creating a symlink in "manual" and "own" or whatever
implement filter categories with symbolic links
HTTP URL should be retrieved from details, not from the DB
script which cleans up the disk on a regular basis (might not be working though)
