To do:

HTTP URL should be retrieved from details, not from the DB
add more customisation features to the search results
implement filter categories with symbolic links
add NFO filtering
solve the on-download notification problem
need status stuff, XMLRPC data from rtorrent
integrate further sites

Problematic stuff:

add tcng/tcc QoS stuff - requires a newer kernel

Done:

script which cleans up the disk on a regular basis (might not be working though)
