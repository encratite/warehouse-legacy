To do:

add genre filters for TorrentVault
fix the dates in the TV database
add a seed check for TV downloads?
symlinks should get updated when you add/remove a filter
add more customisation features to the search results
solve the on-download notification problem
need status stuff, XMLRPC data from rtorrent

Problematic stuff:

add tcng/tcc QoS stuff - requires a proper kernel

Done:

the cleaner should remove symlinks, too
integrate further sites (TorrentVault, oh well)
add NFO filtering
add symlinks for NFO hits in the categoriser
the categoriser should check what user issued a download, creating a symlink in "manual" and "own" or whatever
implement filter categories with symbolic links
HTTP URL should be retrieved from details, not from the DB
script which cleans up the disk on a regular basis (might not be working though)
