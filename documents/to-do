To do:

implement filter categories with symbolic links
add more customisation features to the search results
add NFO filtering
solve the on-download notification problem
need status stuff, XMLRPC data from rtorrent
integrate further sites

Problematic stuff:

add tcng/tcc QoS stuff - requires a newer kernel

Done:

HTTP URL should be retrieved from details, not from the DB
script which cleans up the disk on a regular basis (might not be working though)
