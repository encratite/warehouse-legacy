Patches of standard components that were required to make this system work:

Ruby 1.9:
/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/xmlrpc/parser.rb

Extend all "i4 int" handlers to "i4 i8 int" pretty much for 64-bit handling with rtorrent

replace "i4 int" "i4 i8 int" < parser.rb > parser.rb.patched
mv parser.rb parser.rb.original
cp parser.rb.patched parser.rb

Another replacement is necessary:

"i4", "int" -> "i4", "i8", "int"
