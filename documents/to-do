To do:

find out why the fuck "test-release" has no symlink (urgh I get it)
symlinks should get updated when you add/remove a filter
the cleaner should remove symlinks, too
add more customisation features to the search results
add NFO filtering
solve the on-download notification problem
need status stuff, XMLRPC data from rtorrent
integrate further sites

Problematic stuff:

add tcng/tcc QoS stuff - requires a newer kernel

Done:

the categoriser should check what user issued a download, creating a symlink in "manual" and "own" or whatever
implement filter categories with symbolic links
HTTP URL should be retrieved from details, not from the DB
script which cleans up the disk on a regular basis (might not be working though)
